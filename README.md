### Hi! I'm Harsha Somisetty


Currently a Junior at Rutgers, triple majoring in Math, CS, Stats. [Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GccuGcXmZ6tDAI0Y_svTLM5yTiuQJBqra5AY8o4xE2g/edit)

My current focus is improving my developer skills in systems software in OS, networking, distributed computing, security, and databases

In the past, I've studied a lot of ML/DS concepts through multiple grad courses and projects:
- Created [Checkra](https://checkra.co/podcasts), a system that transcribes podcasts, automatically detects topics and generates timestamps.
  - Checkra backend currently private, but front end is public
- Researched Topological Data Analysis to time series data, specifically applications to generate volatility signals for markets
  - Notebooks are public
- Built a system to apply pagerank to detect hype from reputable trading-related Twitter accounts
  - Currently private


I'm most fluent in Python, and especially good at Googling what I need to adapt to any situation.
